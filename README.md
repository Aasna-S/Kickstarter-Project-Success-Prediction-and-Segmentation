This repository showcases the development of two distinct machine learning models utilizing the Kickstarter dataset. The primary objective is twofold: firstly, to create a classification model for predicting project outcomes (success or failure), and secondly, to cluster Kickstarter projects based on various features.

Classification Model:
Using the Random Forest algorithm, I developed a supervised learning model to predict the 'state' variable as 'successful' or 'failure.'

Clustering Model:
For grouping projects, I implemented K-Means clustering, an unsupervised learning approach, adept at segmenting the Kickstarter dataset into meaningful categories.
This model is instrumental in uncovering patterns and trends, initially concentrating on projects identified as 'successful' or 'failed,' and leveraging key features such as project goals, pledged amounts, and various time-related variables.
